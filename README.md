# Discgo

A Discord API client library written in Go

This is not a full client, and is intended to provide support for certain Discord API interactions as I have the need. Perhaps in time full support will be added.

* Better support for metrics and tracing
* A modules structure I like
* Respect SemVer with breaking changes
* Because I want to try
